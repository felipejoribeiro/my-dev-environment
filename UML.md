## UML: Unified Modeling Language
---

The UML is a standardized form of drawing programs. It uses boxes and lines to describe functions and calls. This allows better communication between programmers even if they program in different languages. The reason for this is that this technique describes how to communicate programming logic through diagrams therefore not concerning syntax of any kind. There are even programs that let you code with UML, those are the visual scripting languages and they are used to let logic programming more approachable for non programming individuals. Examples of this are in blender and unity development environment and are common in shader programming.
